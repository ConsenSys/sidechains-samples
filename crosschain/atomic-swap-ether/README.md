## Running the Sample Code

This sample is to be used with two crosschain-enabled Hyperledger Besu instances
each operating as a node on three separate sidechains. See the _crosschain_ directory in the
[sidechains-besu github respository](https://github.com/PegaSysEng/sidechains-besu/tree/master/crosschain)
 for details of how to build and deploy the Hyperledger Besu instances. 

The instances need to operate as follows:
* Sidechain 1: Sidechain ID: 11. Address http://127.0.0.1:8110/ 
* Sidechain 2: Sidechain ID: 22. Address http://127.0.0.1:8220/
